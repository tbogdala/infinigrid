TODO
=======

* AutoHeadLevel, or something like it should be done at app start
  (hmdLoc not set during GameScene Initialize)

* Collisions are not being created for the components yet

* Controller Ideas for Vive Wand
    * side grips return ship to neutral
    * touchpad sensor controls movement of ship left/right up/down
      ... this possibly can be done by just rotation of wand itself,
      maybe leave it as an option
